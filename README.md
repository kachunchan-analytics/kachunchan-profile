# 👋 Hi there, I'm Andy!
Welcome to my profile! 💻 I'm Chan Ka Chun, and you may also call me Andy. 

I love diving into financial data with Python. 📈 I'm also skilled in Javascript and HTML, rounding out my web development toolkit. <br>
How about LLM and prompt engineering? They ARE my beloved helpers!! AI with Python🐍🐍 is one of my hobbies!!

I also have a healthcare background for which I am planning to launch a project to digitally transform the healthcare system.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you want to join my project (I am EAGER to teamwork with people).
