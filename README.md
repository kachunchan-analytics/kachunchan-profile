# 👋 Hi there, welcome to my profile!
I'm Chan Ka Chun, but you can call me Andy. I'm from Hong Kong and passionate about exploring the world of finance using Python 📈. <br>

I'm also comfortable with Javascript and HTML, which makes up my web development toolkit. <br>

When it comes to AI, I enjoy working with LLMs and prompt engineering, and I've had fun experimenting with AI-powered projects using Python 🐍🐍. <br>


Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to join my project – I'm eager to collaborate with others! 🤝

# My Project
In addition to my tech interests, I have a background in healthcare and am planning to launch a project aimed at **digitally transforming** the healthcare system. I'm eager to collaborate with **like-minded** individuals to bring this project to life.

# Let's connect! 🤝
